FizzBuzz is a well known programming assignment, asked during interviews.

The given code solves the FizzBuzz problem and uses the words "Solo" and "Learn" instead of "Fizz" and "Buzz".
It takes an input n and outputs the numbers from 1 to n.
For each multiple of 3, print "Solo" instead of the number.
For each multiple of 5, prints "Learn" instead of the number.
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, output "SoloLearn".

You need to change the code to skip the even numbers, so that the logic only applies to odd numbers in the range.

You have been asked to make a special book categorization program, which assigns each book a special code based on its title.
The code is equal to the first letter of the book, followed by the number of characters in the title.
For example, for the book "Harry Potter", the code would be: H12, as it contains 12 characters (including the space).

You are provided a books.txt file, which includes the book titles, each one written on a separate line.
Read the title one by one and output the code for each book on a separate line.

For example, if the books.txt file contains:
Some book
Another book

The Fibonacci sequence is one of the most famous formulas in mathematics.
Each number in the sequence is the sum of the two numbers that precede it.
For example, here is the Fibonacci sequence for 10 numbers, starting from 0: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34.

Write a program to take N (variable num in code template) positive numbers as input, and recursively calculate and output the first N numbers of the Fibonacci sequence (starting from 0).

You are given a Juice class, which has name and capacity properties.
You need to complete the code to enable and adding of two Juice objects, resulting in a new Juice object with the combined capacity and names of the two juices being added.

For example, if you add an Orange juice with 1.0 capacity and an Apple juice with 2.5 capacity, the resulting juice should have:
name: Orange&Apple
capacity: 3.5

The names have been combined using an & symbol.

You are given a number input, and need to check if it is a valid phone number.
A valid phone number has exactly 8 digits and starts with 1, 8 or 9.
Output "Valid" if the number is valid and "Invalid", if it is not.
